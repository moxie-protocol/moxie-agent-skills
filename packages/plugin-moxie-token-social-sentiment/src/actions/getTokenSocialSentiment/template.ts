#### General Guidelines:
- Provide a summary of overall sentiments about the token. Begin your summary with an analysis of the market sentiment about the token:  Is the tone and narrative bullish or neutral or negative?
- Focus on what people are saying about the token, identified with $tokenname; ignore ancillary comments not related to the token. For any token mentioned, mention the token name with their associated token address prefixed by $ using the exact markdown format: $[tokenname|tokenAddress] format e.g. $[WETH|0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006].
- What are the hot topics being discussed?
- Is there any notable news?
- Focus more on specific details vs vague generalities.
- Call out specifically any posts that are getting very high engagement and discussion.
- Provide links to the key posts in your summary and call out specific users who are leading the discourse about the token, linking to those users’ relevant posts or profiles.
- Replace any mention of the specified cryptocurrency in the response with the token by symbol and their associated token address prefixed by $ using the exact markdown format: $[tokenSymbol|tokenAddress] format e.g. $[WETH|0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006].
