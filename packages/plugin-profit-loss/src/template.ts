Step 1: Identify which type of query the question refers to. It might be about a user, wallet, token, user or wallet & a token, group, or overall. Based on this follow the instructions below.

####  General  Rules
- Present the data in a table format, use the dollar sign inside the table to indicate money where needed.
- Write a quick intro about the PnL analysis. Do mention that this PnL is for all-time realized gains, from wallets trading on DEXs. The PnL amounts are indicative only.
- Agent can also be called senpi.
- When mentioning users: mention by name and link to them using the exact markdown format: @[username|user_id] format e.g. @[zoravar|M234]. If username is not available, use the exact format: @[user_id|user_id] e.g. @[M234|M234]. Do not add any extra characters such as slashes.
- When mentioning token symbols: mention the token symbol and their associated token address prefixed by $ using the exact markdown format: $[tokenSymbol|tokenAddress] format e.g. $[WETH|0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006].
- At the end of the response, mention the timeframe the PnL was for, and also remind the user they can ask for 1, 7, 30 or lifetime PnL too.

#### If the question is about user or wallet:
- Make sure to call out the total PnL in the beginning.

### If the question is about user or wallet for a particular token:
- Skip total PnL.
- Make sure to identify which address is wallet and which is token.

### If the question is about token PnL (e.g. who are the top traders of a token):
- Mention the token name in the introduction, skip the token name/symbol from the table.
- Skip total PnL.

### If the question is about group PnL:
- Mention the group name in the introduction.
- Show total PnL for the group.
- Show the percentage change of the group PnL.
- Show individual member PnLs in the table.
- Sort members by their PnL (highest to lowest).

#### Required These Exact Fields in Response:
- User Name (only for token PnL)
- Token Symbol (Mention the token symbol and their associated token address prefixed by $ using the exact markdown format: $[tokenSymbol|tokenAddress] format e.g. $[WETH|0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006])
- Total Profit/Loss
- Total Buy Amount (USD)
- Total Sell Amount (USD)
- Number of Buy Transactions (not needed for group PnL)
- Number of Sell Transactions (not needed for group PnL)

## PnL data: {{pnlData}}

## Total PnL: {{totalPnl}}

## Percentage of PnL: {{percentagePnl}}

export const extractWalletTemplate = `
Your objective is to identify the type of the request and extract important information from a given user message, then generate a structured JSON response.

### Query types
1. User/Wallet/User&Token or Group queries
   - TYPE: "wallet"
   - VALUE: "0x....."

   - TYPE: "ens"
   - VALUE: "chetan.eth"

   - TYPE: "moxieUserId"
   - VALUE: "M[number_string]"
     Can also contain token address to specifically show PnL for the user & that token.

   - TYPE: "group"
   - VALUE: "[group_id]"
     Extract only the UUID for group queries.


2. Criteria for Token PnL:
   - TYPE: "tokenAddress"
   - VALUE: "0x....."
     User query can contain a 0x format token address, or $[token_symbol|token_address](example: $[USDC|0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913]), you only need 0x address.

3. Criteria for Overall PnL (Best Traders):
   - TYPE: "overall"
   - VALUE: "best_traders"

4. Group PnL Queries:
   - TYPE: "group"
   - VALUE: "[group_name|group_id]"
     Queries can be:
     - show PnL for group #[Group Name|UUID]
     - what's pnl for #[Group Name|UUID]

### Timeframe Extraction
- If the query specifies "24 hours," convert it to "1d."
- If the query specifies a timeframe, format it using only days or "lifetime." Use formats like "1d", "7d", "30d" or "lifetime".

### Response format example:
\`\`\`json
{
  "criteria": [
    {
      "TYPE": "[query type]",
      "VALUE": "[query value]"
    }
  ],
  "analysisType": "PROFIT",
  "maxResults": 20,
  "chain": "base",
  "timeFrame": "[formatted timeframe if applicable]"
}

General rules:
- If the query mentions both ENS and moxieUserId - use moxieUserId.
- If the query mentions "my PnL", or "I earned/lost" use the following UserId: {{moxieUserId}}
- If the query mentions "my agent PnL/senpi PnL" use the following wallet address: {{agentWalletAddress}}
- Agent can also be called senpi.
- Focus on the latest message to extract information.
