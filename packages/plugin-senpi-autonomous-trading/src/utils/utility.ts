2. Make sure to specify a trigger amount: e.g. if 2 people in #copytrade buy >$1000 of a token.
3. Make sure to specify a time period, e.g. "if 2 people in #copytrade buy >$1000 of a token within 30 minutes of each other..."
4. Make sure to specify an amount to buy for you: "if 2 people in #copytrade buy >$1000 of a token within 30 minutes of each other, buy me $400 of it..."
